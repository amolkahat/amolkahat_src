From last 3 months [Pythonpune](http://www.meetup.com/PythonPune/) community organizing **Machine Learning and Data Analysis** meetups. This time [Pythonpune](http://www.meetup.com/PythonPune/) community organized **Data Analysis Hackathon**, this event was organized in **Red Hat India Pvt. Ltd**. Magarpatta City, Pune.

[Sudarshan Gadhve](https://twitter.com/sudarshan1989) was the speaker. At the beginning of the session he gave brief introduction to Data Analysis and python-pandas. Then, he showed some data set and told people what is participants' goals.

In the hackathon nearly 25 people were present. People had freedom to choose any dataset. So many of them choose Indian Rail dataset, Titanic dataset etc. I chose Indian Rail dataset. The dataset was csv file with 12 columns and approx 6-7k rows.

<!--more-->We seated in 4-5 groups, and each group was working on different datasets. In my group we were 5 people. In my group everyone was new to python-pandas. I gave some introduction of python-pandas to my group members, then we started working on Indian Rail dataset.

Actually I was novice to python-pandas. So at the end of the session people presented what they had done during the hackathon. Some of them analysed the data and found out the ratio of Male and Female in each year, some of them analysed Titanic dataset and found out how many of them survived.

One of my group mate analysed data and grouped the data according to various 'Train No'.  I was trying something but it was not completed.  At the end of session Sudarshan presented some of his data analysis on train datasets. He showed us how to analyse it, how to clean the data, how to plot specific data using matplotlib.
