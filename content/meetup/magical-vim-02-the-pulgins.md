Today i arranged the Vim meetup. It was conducted by Dev and his friend. This meetup was organised in [PIIC, warje Pune](http://piic.co.in/). One of the friend of mine Shishir Vaidya from PIIC, helps me to organize the meetup.

Vim meetup was cool. [Ganesh](http://www.meetup.com/Pune-vim-users/members/183066483/) friend of Dev he explained vim plugins. He explained many plugins. I did't know about this plugins and i never think about that. First he explains about [Vim-Airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline) plugin which is used to decorate the vim. It is an awesome plugin with cool themes. I liked it and sure i'm going to install it in my laptop.

<!--more-->What if you get Git integration in vim to code analysis? Yeah that plugin is vim [gitgutter](https://github.com/airblade/vim-gitgutter). So if you modified any git repository file it will show you modified lines. With this plugin you can use git commands like add, commit, etc.

So that was the main topic in vim meetup. Ajay also explains different plugins in short, like [fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive), [note](https://github.com/xolox/vim-notes), [YouComplteteMe](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe), [Nerdtree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree), [vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim), [powerline](https://github.com/Lokaltog/vim-powerline) etc.

Actually this meetup was short but great and I like it. Thanks Ganesh and Dev to organize this meetup. Thanks PIIC for arrangements.
