April Fedora meetup was held in Kushal Das's home in jasmenium, magarpatta city Pune at 6 PM evening. This time fedora meetup take new turn which was very exciting. Officially this meetup was about discussing RPM packaging and migration of python2 to python3. But Kushal and Pravenn Kumar change the meetup agenda at the spot.

They gave small test cases to everyone (attendees). And tell them to write test cases for that, using python unittest framework. The test cases was some Linux commands which we can break like adduser, deluser, mount, umount etc. That was cool many peoples was completed their task easily.

<!--more-->Amazing thing that the test cases which we wrote, those test cases going to merge in fedora testing repository. That was my first Open Source contribution.

In Kushal's home i met his daughter, her name is "**Py**", she is may be 2 yrs old. I was curious about her name,  i think that Kushal kept her name after "**Pie**", one another Red Hat Employee. Who was active member in Red Hat's mailing list. So i ask Kushal that you kept her name after Pie?. So he's reply was "No, we kept her name after Python". "Py" her name is as cute as python and she is as cute as python.

Thanks Kushal, Pravin and Chandan to host meetup. Thank you [Anwesha](https://twitter.com/anweshasrkr) for snakes and cold drinks.
