This year in July 2017 we (Python Pune meetup) started with the 4 months of planning. This series was like Zero to Hero Python meetups.  Basically, this idea was suggested by [**Chandan**](https://twitter.com/chkumar246) to me.

**So what was the 4 months series?**

This series was like learning Python from basics to advance level. In this series, the first session was on Python Basics, which is conducted by me in **[Tixdo media](https://twitter.com/tixdo_), Magarpatta, Pune.** Around 40 participants were there for learning Python.

In the second session, we created TODO app using Django framework. It was a very awesome session which held in the [**Talentica Softwares, Baner.**](https://twitter.com/Talentica) This session is conducted by **Arjun Yadav**, who worked with **[Amazatic Softwares](https://twitter.com/amazatic), Baner**. He was very good at the Django, flask and other Java Scripts technologies.

The third meetup session completely based on writing the unit tests. It was held in the **[PTC Softwares](https://twitter.com/PTC), Kalyani Nagar, Pune**.  In this session, I taught how to write the unit tests using Python unittest framework as well as how to run it using Python and pytest framework.

In the same session, **[Rishika Goyal](https://twitter.com/rishika7000)** explained how to write behave tests for the web application. After that [**Samriddhi** **Agarwal**](https://twitter.com/Samridhiagarwa7) gave session on Wikidata. It was very awesome session conducted by Rishika and Samridhi.<!--more-->

The 4th and last session was Dev Sprint, which is held in **[Red Hat India Pvt. Ltd.](https://twitter.com/redhatopen)  Magarpatta, Pune** office. In this Dev Sprint, 3-4 projects mentors were present.

In the Dev Sprint most of the participants committed to the [**Ansible**](https://twitter.com/ansible) project, Some participants submitted patches to the [**conda-forge**](https://twitter.com/condaforge) and **Numba** projects. [**Girish Joshi**](https://twitter.com/girish946) was there with his hardware stuff, who was working with [**Nikhil Dhandre**](https://twitter.com/girish946) on debugging the different issues with hardware.

[**Abhijeet Kausrde**](https://twitter.com/Pyro46) and **[Ganesh Nalawade](https://twitter.com/ganesh634)** was there as a mentor to Ansible porject, and Sourabh Singh was there for mentoring conda-forge and Numba projects.

We got the best feedback from the participants for this event as well as for the 4 months planning series.

I would like to say thank you to venue sponsors (**Tixdo, Talentica, PTC, Red Hat**) for providing the venue. I would like to say thank you to the speakers as well as mentors in dev sprint for mentoring the projects.
