HexChat / Xchat is best IRC client to get started. If you are using this from long time then believe that you need some thrill.

**So what I've done ??**

I installed *irssi ,* and forget that i have best GUI based IRC clients. After installing i started hacking with the irssi. So basics of the irssi is same as the Hexchat / Xchat. But that i get to know after i started hacking on irssi.

I was searching for another terminal based IRC clients and i found *weechat.* Weechat is same as irssi but with large set of plugins in python and more customization options are available.

I configured weechat with freenode server and it's default channels like, \#fedora-india, \#fedora-hubs, \#fedora-apps, \#pypune, \#pyconpune etc. So configuring it like a fun. I completely rely on keyboard to check the messages and etc.

IRC commands which i learned:

1.  **connect :** To connect the server` /connect freenode `
2.  **Join :** To join the channel `/join #fedora-india`
3.  **server :** To add, list and remove IRC servers.
4.  **query:  **For private chat.
5.  **exit :** To exit IRC client.

So now i'm trying to get used to with it. Let's see how long i'm going to use it. I learn 5 commands in a day. And that's basics of the IRC.  Believe or not but hole one day i'm just using that commands.

Now let's start using it's shortcuts. :P
